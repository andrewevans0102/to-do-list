# to-do-list
- An Angular 7 app is hosted on Firebase and uses CircleCi for deployment
- You can view this [app deployed on Firebase here](https://to-do-list-70328.firebaseapp.com) 
- Firebase does a lot more than just hosting, setup an account and checkout the documentation here [firebase link](https://firebase.google.com/)
- Using Firebase with your Angular code requires some binding and additional help with the AngularFire2 library.  Checkout the GitHub site and associated documenatation here [AnularFire2](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2)
- This project also uses a custom script for code coverage, if you run `npm run coverage-report` it will use Angular's code coverage report to show you how well the unit tests are covering the project
- Checkout my post on CircleCi deployment for a walkthrough of setting up your app for CircleCi [Post Link](https://rhythmandbinary.com/2018/10/19/circle-ci/)
- This project is also the example for my Anular-In-Depth blog post on [The Angular DevOps Series: Deploying to Firebase with CircleCI](https://blog.angularindepth.com/deploying-an-angular-site-to-firebase-with-circleci-ed881cb6a2fa)
